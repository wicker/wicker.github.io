I'm a hardware developer who focuses on building networks of sensors to collect environmental data, whether indoors, in a city, or in a river or forest. 

#### Wickerbox Electronics

I develop both open and closed source hardware as a freelancer through <a href="http://wickerbox.net/">Wickerbox Electronics</a>, my company, but I prefer to develop in the open whenever I can. 

<!--I wrote a series of articles called <a href="#">Setting up a KiCad Workflow</a> about using KiCad, a free and open source schematic capture tool. My libraries, tools, Pandoc and LaTeX templates, and all my KiCad-related scripts are public.-->

<!--#### Conference Talks

I talked at OpenSourceBridge about <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1365">Math vs Mathematics</a> and <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1618">Design from Breadboard to PCB</a> in 2014, and about <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1618">Getting Started with KiCad</a> in 2015.<-->

#### Hardware 

My Master's is in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on hardware, so that's what makes up most of my projects. My early designs were in Eagle but now I work exclusively in KiCad. I develop both standalone boards and attachable boards that fit platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Teensy. 

Here's some of what I do: 

- reverse engineer existing boards with no documentation
- work with the client to figure out requirements 
- order boxes or cases and design the boards to fit
- research, research, research, and then select components
- design circuits and create circuit schematics
- make the board layout by drawing the traces and placing parts 
- order and maintain inventory of boards, stencils, and parts
- assemble boards by hand soldering, reflow oven, and hot air station
- test and troubleshoot the boards

I'm <a href="http://www.wickerbox.net">available for hire</a> so most of my work is closed source and proprietary, but here's some of my open source work:

- <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/Basic-Breakout-Boards">Breakout Boards</a> - <em>Breadboard-compatible boards for prototyping.</em>
- <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/Teensy-Hats">Teensy Hats</a> - <em>Collection of daughter boards for the Teensy series.</em>
- <a href="http://wickerbox.net/input-power-boards/">Input Power Boards</a> - <em>Breadboard-compatible soldering practice kit.</em>
- <a href="http://wickerbox.net/arduino-theremin/">Arduino Theremin</a> - <em>Rangefinder-based theremin shield.</em>
- <a href="http://wickerbox.net/3g-cellphone/">3G Cellphone Prototype</a> - <em>Based on the 2G Cellphone.</em>
- <a href="http://wickerbox.net/gps-rf-front-end/">GPS RF Front-end Board</a> - <em>For the Portland State Aerospace Society.</em>
- <a href="http://wickerbox.net/reflow-oven-controller/">Reflow Oven Controller</a> - <em>For a composites curing oven at Portland State.</em>
- <a href="http://wickerbox.net/quadcopter-control-board/">Quadcopter Control Board</a> - <em>With onboard 9DOF, XBee, and motor control.</em>

#### Software

I've written a lot of random scripts and programs, mostly to learn languages or explore ideas. I'm familiar with ARM Assembly, VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog, C, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Liquid. 

I use Git for version control, and I serve my websites with Jekyll on Github.  

Lately, I've been trying my hand at building web apps using FreeCodeCamp.org's coursework. Here's what I've built so far:
