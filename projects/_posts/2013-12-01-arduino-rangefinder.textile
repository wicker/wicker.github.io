So there's something like eighty years of history behind a theremin. This isn't a theremin. This is me fucking around on a sleepy Saturday in Seattle with an ultrasonic rangefinder, an Arduino, and MIDI headers. But I got the idea because of theremins.

I wanted to use the Arduino to sample the rangefinder and produce musical notes.

I needed a reference for what the text of a MIDI file looks like in comma-separated values so I downloaded Avicii's Wake Me Up and used the midicsv script from Fourmilab to get the CSV file. Then I stripped out as much of the header as possible to see what it takes for timidity to still play it. Turns out a file with just this header will still play:

<code>0, 0, Header, 0, 1, 120</code>
<code>1, 0, Start_track</code>

I wired the Maxbotix LV-EZ4 ultrasonic rangefinder to the Arduino via a protoshield and wrote a script to sample the rangefinder for a finite period of time and turn the distance measurements into octaves. I didn't make it output a file; you have to actually copy the results from the Arduino's serial monitor. Obviously it'd be better to just get a file and script the whole process.

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
{% highlight c++  %}
const int pwPin = 7;

long pulse, inches, cm;
int outOctave, count;

void setup() {
  count = 0;
  
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("0, 0, Header, 0, 1, 120");
  Serial.println("1, 0, Start_track");
}

void loop() {
  pinMode(pwPin, INPUT);
  
  pulse = pulseIn(pwPin, HIGH);
  inches = pulse/147;
  cm = inches * 2.54;
  delay(250);
  
  if (inches <= 7)
    outOctave = 10;
  else if (inches >= 24)
    outOctave = 120;
  else
    outOctave = inches*5;
    
  Serial.print("1, ");
  Serial.print(count);
  Serial.print(", Note_on_c, 11, ");
  Serial.print(outOctave);
  Serial.println(", 127");
  
  if (count > 2000)
  {
    Serial.print("1, ");
    Serial.print(count + 50);
    Serial.println(", End_track");
    Serial.println("0, 0, End_of_file");
    return;
  }
  count = count + 100;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

I took the CSV file I'd made by copying and pasting and applied the csvmidi script in the other direction (CSV->MIDI). It's a pretty limited file, which you can play using timidity.
